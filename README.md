## Pages and Functions

    + categories preview modules (with/without tabs, pagination and other functions)
    + classic info-sections

## Elements and Hooks
I wanted to show, that I can use different types of elements and hooks, so in this project you will see:
* class components
* functional components
* arrow functions components
* recursion
* useState
* useReducer
* useContext
* useEffect
* useCallback
* useMemo
* React.memo
* useRef

Want to notice, that I understand, that it's not a right way to make a structure of product, it's just a way to show my skills (sometimes I used unnecessary things just for demonstrating)

## Design

Take a look to the design, I made this website according to.
